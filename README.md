## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about mobile first development in this project, as I had to set different CSS styles based on screen size and wanted to do so in a concise, efficient way. I also learned how I can utilize flexbox to create a responsive layout that will stack items vertically given a small-enough screen.
This was also a cool opportunity to learn how to use external icons (and how to mix them from different sources)!

### Continued development

I would like to continue getting used to using flexbox and creating responsive layouts. I would also like to continue exploring best practices for media queries/CSS.
